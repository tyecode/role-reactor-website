## Step-by-Step Setup
1. List the main subjects and study styles in your community.
2. Assign clear emoji to each subject and group.
3. Use the `/role-reactions setup` command with the following roles string:

    ```markdown
    #Subjects
    📊:Mathematics
    🔬:Science
    📚:English
    🏛️:History
    #Study Groups
    👥:Group Study
    🤫:Solo Study
    📅:Evening Study
    ```
4. Instruct members to react to join study groups or get subject notifications.

## Example Role Message
```markdown
#Subjects
📊:Mathematics
🔬:Science
📚:English
🏛️:History
#Study Groups
👥:Group Study
🤫:Solo Study
📅:Evening Study
```

## Advanced Customization
- Add more subjects or group types as your server grows.
- Use custom emoji for school branding or mascot.
- Create separate role messages for courses, clubs, or events.

## Troubleshooting
