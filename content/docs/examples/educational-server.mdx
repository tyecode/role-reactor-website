## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Identify the main subjects and study styles in your community
2. Assign clear, recognizable emojis to each subject and group
3. Ensure the following roles exist in your server:
   - **Mathematics** - For math students
   - **Science** - For science students
   - **English** - For English students
   - **History** - For history students
   - **Group Study** - For group study participants
   - **Solo Study** - For solo study participants
   - **Evening Study** - For evening study sessions

### Role Message Creation

Execute the following command to create your educational role message:

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Study Groups description:Join subject-based study communities! roles:📊:Mathematics,🔬:Science,📚:English,🏛️:History,👥:Group Study,🤫:Solo Study,📅:Evening Study
```

### Verification

After creating the role message:

- Test role assignment by clicking reactions
- Verify members can assign and remove roles
- Confirm the bot has proper permissions

## Advanced Customization

- Add additional subjects or group types as your server grows
- Use custom emojis for school branding or mascot
- Create separate role messages for courses, clubs, or events
- Organize roles by academic level or semester

## Troubleshooting
