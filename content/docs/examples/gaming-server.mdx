## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before creating the role message, ensure the following roles exist in your server:

- **PC Gaming** - For PC gamers
- **PlayStation** - For PlayStation players
- **Xbox** - For Xbox players
- **Mobile** - For mobile gamers
- **FPS** - For first-person shooter fans
- **RPG** - For role-playing game enthusiasts
- **Racing** - For racing game fans
- **Strategy** - For strategy game players

### Role Message Creation

Execute the following command to create your gaming role message:

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Gaming Platforms description:Choose your preferred gaming platform! roles:🖥️:PC Gaming,🎮:PlayStation,🎯:Xbox,📱:Mobile
```

For game genres, create a separate message:

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Game Genres description:What types of games do you enjoy? roles:🔫:FPS,⚔️:RPG,🏎️:Racing,🎲:Strategy
```

### Verification

After creating the role message:

- Test role assignment by clicking reactions
- Verify members can assign and remove roles
- Confirm the bot has proper permissions

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Role Messages

For larger gaming communities, create separate role messages for different purposes:

#### Platform Selection

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Gaming Platforms description:Choose your main gaming platform roles:🖥️:PC Gaming,🎮:PlayStation,🎯:Xbox,📱:Mobile,🕹️:Nintendo
```

#### Game Genres

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Favorite Genres description:What types of games do you enjoy? roles:🔫:FPS,⚔️:RPG,🏎️:Racing,🎲:Strategy,👥:MMO,🎮:Action
```

#### Activity Level

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Gaming Activity description:How often do you game? roles:🌟:Daily Gamer,🌙:Weekend Warrior,📱:Casual Player,🏆:Competitive
```

### Temporary Roles for Events

Use temporary roles for special gaming events:

```bash
/temp-roles assign users:@user1,@user2 role:@Tournament Participant duration:3h reason:Gaming tournament notify:true
```
