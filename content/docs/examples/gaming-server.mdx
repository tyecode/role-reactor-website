- **Mobile** - For mobile gamers
- **FPS** - For first-person shooter fans
- **RPG** - For role-playing game enthusiasts
- **Racing** - For racing game fans
- **Strategy** - For strategy game players

### 2. Create the Role Message

```

### 3. Test It Out

```

### Scheduled Gaming Sessions

```bash
/schedule-role create users:"@user1" role:"@Weekly Gaming Night" type:recurring schedule:"every Friday at 19:00" reason:"Weekly gaming session"
```
