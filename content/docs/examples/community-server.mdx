import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Step-by-Step Setup
1. Decide which interests and activity levels are most relevant for your community.
2. Choose clear emoji for each role.
3. Use the `/role-reactions setup` command with the following roles string:

    ```markdown
    #Interests
    ðŸŽ¨:Art
    ðŸ“¸:Photography
    ðŸŽµ:Music
    ðŸ“š:Books
    #Activity Level
    ðŸ”¥:Very Active
    ðŸ˜Ž:Casual
    ðŸ‘€:Lurker
    ```
4. Encourage members to react to the message to assign themselves roles.

## Example Role Message
```markdown
#Interests
ðŸŽ¨:Art
ðŸ“¸:Photography
ðŸŽµ:Music
ðŸ“š:Books
#Activity Level
ðŸ”¥:Very Active
ðŸ˜Ž:Casual
ðŸ‘€:Lurker
```

## Advanced Customization
- Add more categories (e.g., #Notifications, #Events) as your community grows.
- Use custom emoji for unique server branding.
- Combine with other templates for multi-purpose servers.

## Troubleshooting
<Callout type="warning">
- **Roles not assigned:** Make sure the bot has Manage Roles permission and its role is above the target roles.
- **Emoji not working:** Use standard emoji or custom emoji the bot can access.
- **Members confused:** Pin a message explaining what each role means.
</Callout>

- Use categories to organize interests and activity levels.<br />
