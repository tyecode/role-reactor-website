## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Identify the interests and activity levels most relevant to your community
2. Select clear, recognizable emojis for each role
3. Ensure the following roles exist in your server:
   - **Art** - For art enthusiasts
   - **Photography** - For photographers
   - **Music** - For music lovers
   - **Books** - For book readers
   - **Very Active** - For highly active members
   - **Casual** - For casual members
   - **Lurker** - For members who prefer to observe

### Role Message Creation

Execute the following command to create your community role message:

```bash
/role-reactions setup title:Community Interests description:Choose your interests and activity level! roles:🎨:Art,📸:Photography,🎵:Music,📚:Books,🔥:Very Active,😎:Casual,👀:Lurker
```

### Verification

After creating the role message:

- Test role assignment by clicking reactions
- Verify members can assign and remove roles
- Confirm the bot has proper permissions

## Advanced Customization

- Add additional categories as your community grows
- Use custom emojis for unique server branding
- Create separate messages for different interest categories
- Combine with other templates for multi-purpose servers

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
- **Roles not assigned:** Verify the bot has Manage Roles permission and its role is positioned above target roles
- **Emoji not working:** Use standard emojis or custom emojis accessible to the bot
- **Members confused:** Pin a message explaining the purpose of each role
</Callout>

- Use clear, recognizable emojis for each interest category<br />
