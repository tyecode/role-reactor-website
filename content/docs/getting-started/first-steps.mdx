## Quick Start Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating your first role message using Role Reactor Bot.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Prepare Roles

Before creating a role message, ensure the roles you want to use exist in your server. For this example, we'll use:

- **Gamer** - For gaming enthusiasts
- **Artist** - For creative members  
- **Developer** - For tech-minded people

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisite:** These roles must exist in your server before creating the role message. Create them in Server Settings > Roles if needed.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Create the Role Message

In any channel where you want the role message to appear, execute:

```
/role-reactions setup title:Choose Your Roles description:React below to assign yourself roles! roles:🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist,💻:Developer
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `title:Choose Your Roles` - Sets the message title
- `description:React below to assign yourself roles!` - Provides instructions
- `roles:🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist,💻:Developer` - Defines emoji-role pairs

<Callout type="info">
**Formatting Note:** Ensure there are no extra spaces around commas in the roles string. Use `🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist` not `🎮:Gamer, 🎨:Artist`.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Test Functionality

1. Locate the newly created message in the channel
2. Click the 🎮 reaction - you should receive the "Gamer" role
3. Verify the role appears in your member sidebar
4. Remove the reaction to confirm the role is removed

<Callout type="check">
**Success:** Your members can now self-assign roles by reacting to your message.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Enhanced Customization

Improve the appearance of your role message with custom formatting and descriptions:

<Tabs items={['Command', 'Result']}>
<Tab value="Command">

```
/role-reactions setup title:🌟 Community Roles description:**Welcome to our server!**\n\nChoose roles that match your interests:\n\n• 🎮 Gaming enthusiasts\n• 🎨 Creative minds\n• 💻 Tech lovers roles:🎮:Gamer,🎨:Artist,💻:Developer

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"The bot didn't respond to my command"**
- Verify the bot has permission to send messages in that channel
- Confirm the command syntax is correct (start with `/role-reactions setup`)

**"Members can't get roles when they react"**
- Verify role names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure the bot's role is positioned above the roles it's trying to assign
- Confirm the bot has "Manage Roles" permission

**"The emoji reactions didn't appear"**
- The bot requires "Add Reactions" permission
- Custom emojis may not be available to the bot

### Quick Resolution Steps

1. Verify bot permissions in channel settings
2. Check role hierarchy in Server Settings > Roles
3. Test with simple role names (avoid special characters)
