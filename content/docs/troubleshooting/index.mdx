### Bot Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Bot doesn't respond to commands or emoji reactions

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Check Bot Status**
    - Is the bot online? (Green status in member list)

  </Step>
  
  <Step>

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Check Role Position**

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Roles Not Being Assigned

**Symptoms:** Reactions work but members don't get roles

<Callout type="warn">
**Most Common Cause:** Bot's role is positioned below the roles it's trying to assign
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Fix Role Hierarchy**
    1. Go to Server Settings > Roles
    2. Drag the bot's role above all roles you want it to manage
    3. Test role assignment again
  </Step>

### Reactions Missing

**Symptoms:** Emoji reactions don't appear or disappear

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Refresh Reactions**
    ```
    Contact support to refresh reactions for a specific message
    ```
    This fixes most reaction-related issues
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Check Bot Permissions**
    - Bot needs "Add Reactions" permission
    - Bot needs "Manage Messages" permission
    - Check channel-specific permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>
