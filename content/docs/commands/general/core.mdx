## Core Credit System

The Core credit system is a credit-based economy for AI avatar generation. Users can earn Cores through donations or membership subscriptions.

### How It Works

1. **Donations**: Donate via Ko-fi to receive Cores (10 Cores per $1)
2. **Memberships**: Subscribe to monthly membership tiers for recurring Cores
3. **Avatar Generation**: Use 1 Core per AI avatar generation
4. **Balance Tracking**: Your balance is tracked across all servers

### Membership Tiers

- **Core Basic** ($10/month): 150 Cores per month
- **Core Premium** ($25/month): 400 Cores per month
- **Core Elite** ($50/month): 850 Cores per month

### Donation Rates

- **Minimum Donation**: $1
- **Core Rate**: 10 Cores per $1 donated
- **Automatic Processing**: Cores are added automatically after donation verification
