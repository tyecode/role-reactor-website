  <Card title="No parameters required" description="This command shows sponsor information and support options" />
</Cards>

## Step-by-Step Example
1. Run the command:
   ```bash
   /sponsor
   ```
2. The bot will display an embed with:
   - Information about supporting the bot's development
   - Why supporting helps keep the bot free
   - How to support (with interactive button if configured)
   - Development and maintenance benefits

## What the Response Shows
- **üåü Support the Bot** - Main title and description
- **ü§ù Why Support?** - Reasons to support development and maintenance
- **üíù How to Support** - Information about donation options
- **Interactive Button** - "Become a Sponsor" button (if configured)
- **Footer** - Shows who requested the command and timestamp

## Features
- **No pressure approach** - Support is completely optional
- **Clear information** - Explains how donations help the bot
- **Interactive elements** - Direct link to sponsorship page
- **Flexible support** - One-time or recurring donations accepted

## Troubleshooting
<Callout type="warning">
- **No response:** Make sure the bot is online and has permission to send messages.<br />
- **Missing button:** The sponsor button only appears if a sponsor link is configured in the bot settings.
</Callout>

## Best Practices
<Callout type="success">
- **Support is optional** - The bot works perfectly without any sponsorship.<br />
- **Every bit helps** - Even small donations support development and maintenance.<br />
- **No pressure** - Only support if you want to help keep the bot free for everyone.
</Callout>
