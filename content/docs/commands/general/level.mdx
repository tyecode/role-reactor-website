## How XP Works
- **Gaining XP:** Users earn XP by being active in the server (sending messages, participating in voice channels)
- **Level progression:** Higher levels require more XP to reach
- **Automatic updates:** XP is awarded automatically based on server activity

## Features
- **Current level:** Shows the user's current level
- **Experience points:** Displays total XP earned
- **Progress bar:** Visual representation of progress to next level
- **XP needed:** Shows how much XP is needed for the next level

## Troubleshooting
<Callout type="warning">
- **No level data:** The user may not have earned any XP yet.<br />
- **XP not updating:** Make sure the XP system is enabled in the server.
</Callout>
